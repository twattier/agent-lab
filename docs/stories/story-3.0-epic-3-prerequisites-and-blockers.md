# Story 3.0: Epic 3 Prerequisites & Blockers Resolution

**Epic:** Epic 3: BMAD Method Workflow Integration
**Story:** 3.0 - Prerequisites & Blockers Resolution (Foundation Story)
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Ready for Development
**Estimated Effort:** 28-38 hours (1 week with 2 developers + QA)
**Priority:** P0-Blocker (Must complete before Stories 3.1-3.5)
**Dependencies:** Epic 2 complete âœ…
**Blocks:** Stories 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5
**Created:** 2025-10-01
**Owner:** Dev Lead + QA Engineer (Quinn)

## Story

**As a** Development Team preparing for Epic 3,
**I want** all Epic 2 technical validations completed, Epic 3 infrastructure configured, and process improvements implemented,
**so that** Epic 3 Stories 3.1-3.5 can execute without blockers, with high quality documentation, and validated integration points.

---

## Story Context

### Why This Story Exists

Epic 3 introduces significant new complexity:

- **External service integrations:** MCP Protocol, OpenAI API, Anthropic Claude API, OLLAMA
- **Complex workflow automation:** Gate management, workflow progression, conversational agents
- **New technology stack:** Model Context Protocol (MCP), LLM provider integrations

**Without Story 3.0 completion:**

- Epic 2 quality gaps (Stories 2.3, 2.4) may propagate into Epic 3
- Integration tests cannot execute (async driver configuration issue)
- Epic 3 external dependency versions undocumented (risk of version conflicts)
- Story documentation gaps (Stories 3.1-3.5 lack detailed handoff docs like Story 2.1)
- Migration validation not automated (risk of repeating Story 2.4 migration inconsistency)

**With Story 3.0 completion:**

- Epic 2 quality scores reach 100/100 (Stories 2.3, 2.4 gaps resolved)
- All integration tests execute reliably in CI/CD
- Epic 3 external dependencies documented and validated
- All Epic 3 stories have Story 2.1-quality developer handoff docs
- Migration validation automated and integrated into CI/CD
- Clear dependency map enables parallel execution (Stories 3.2/3.3)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

**Not applicable for Story 3.0** - This is a validation and configuration story with no new code requiring unit tests.

---

### Integration Tests

**Story 3.0 creates integration tests as deliverables:**

1. **Epic 2 â†’ Epic 3 Integration Tests** (AC8, Task 3.1)
   - File: `apps/api/tests/integration/test_epic_2_to_epic_3.py`
   - 5+ tests validating integration points
   - Run with: `pytest apps/api/tests/integration/test_epic_2_to_epic_3.py -v`

2. **Existing Epic 2 Integration Tests** (AC5, AC7)
   - Validate all Epic 2 integration tests now execute with async driver fix
   - Run with: `pytest apps/api/tests/integration/ -v`
   - Expected: All Epic 2 integration tests passing (100%)

---

### Manual Testing

**Story 3.0 requires extensive manual validation:**

1. **Alembic Migration Validation** (AC2)
   - Manual verification of migration history linearity
   - Manual testing of upgrade/downgrade
   - Manual schema drift detection

2. **Seed Data Validation** (AC6)
   - Manual query of database to verify seed data counts
   - Manual verification of BMAD workflow template structure
   - Manual testing of sample workflow progressions

3. **Developer Handoff Document Review** (AC12-AC16)
   - Dev Lead manual review for technical accuracy
   - Product Owner manual review for completeness
   - Team manual review for clarity and usability

4. **CI/CD Pipeline Testing** (AC10)
   - Manual trigger of CI/CD pipeline with intentional migration issue

### Common Pitfalls

#### Pitfall 1: Async Driver Fix Breaks Other Tests

**Symptom:** After fixing async driver configuration, some existing tests fail

**Cause:** Tests may have hard dependencies on synchronous driver behavior

**Solution:**

- Search codebase for `postgresql://` (synchronous) and update to `postgresql+asyncpg://`
- Update ALL test fixtures to use async driver
- Verify no mixed sync/async database connections

---

#### Pitfall 2: Story Handoff Docs Take Longer Than Estimated

**Symptom:** Creating 5 developer handoff docs takes >15 hours

**Cause:** Underestimating research, code examples, and review cycles

**Solution:**

- Start with Story 3.1 handoff doc (most complex)
- Use completed 3.1 doc as template for 3.2-3.5
- Parallelize: Sarah drafts while Dev Lead reviews
- Timebox each doc: 3 hours max, defer details to story execution

---

#### Pitfall 3: Migration Validation Script Too Complex

**Symptom:** validate_migration.py takes >4 hours to implement

**Cause:** Attempting to validate too many edge cases

**Solution:**

- Start with 5 core checks (linear history, current revision, schema alignment)
- Defer advanced checks (performance, data integrity) to future enhancement
- Use simple pass/fail output, detailed logging optional

---

#### Pitfall 4: External Dependency Version Conflicts

**Symptom:** OpenAI and Anthropic libraries have conflicting dependencies

**Cause:** Incompatible versions of shared dependencies (pydantic, httpx)

**Solution:**

- Use `pip install openai anthropic --dry-run` to preview conflicts
- Choose library versions that share compatible dependencies
- Document any version constraints in EPIC-3-CANONICAL-VERSIONS.md
- Test installation in clean virtual environment

---
