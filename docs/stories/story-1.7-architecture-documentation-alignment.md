# Story 1.7: Architecture Documentation Alignment

## Status

**Done** - QA approved with PASS gate (Quality Score: 100/100)

## Story

**As a** Technical Architect,
**I want** architecture documentation to accurately reflect Epic 1 canonical specifications and delivered implementations,
**so that** developers have consistent, accurate technical references and deployment configurations work correctly.

## Context

**Epic:** Epic 1 - Foundation & Infrastructure Setup
**Created From:** Epic 1 Retrospective (2025-09-30)
**Priority:** P1-Critical (Blocker for Epic 2)
**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 hours
**Type:** Documentation & Technical Debt

### Background

Epic 1 retrospective identified critical version mismatches between Epic 1 canonical specifications (delivered and validated) and architecture documentation. These inconsistencies could cause:

- Deployment failures due to wrong PostgreSQL/pgvector versions
- Developer environment configuration errors
- CI/CD pipeline inconsistencies with Python version mismatches
- Missing documentation of delivered IaC artifacts (Terraform, Docker Swarm, K8s)

**Reference Documents:**

- [Epic 1 Completion Summary](../epics/epic-1-foundation-infrastructure.md#-epic-completion-summary-2025-09-30)
- [Epic 1 Retrospective Action Items](../qa/assessments/epic-1-retrospective-action-items.md)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1: PostgreSQL Version Alignment**
   - All architecture documents reference PostgreSQL 15.4 (not pg17)
   - All docker-compose examples use `pgvector/pgvector:pg15`
   - No references to PostgreSQL 17 remain in architecture docs

2. **AC2: pgvector Extension Version Alignment**
   - Architecture documents reference pgvector 0.5.0 (Epic 1 canonical)
   - Tech stack rationale explains Epic 1 compatibility
   - OR documented decision to upgrade with updated Epic 1 specs

3. **AC3: Python Version Standardization**
   - All architecture documents consistently reference Python 3.11.5
   - CI/CD workflow examples use Python 3.11.5
   - No conflicting Python 3.12 references remain

4. **AC4: Framework Version Verification**
   - FastAPI version verified in codebase and documented accurately
   - TypeScript version verified in codebase and documented accurately
   - Architecture docs match actual deployed versions

5. **AC5: Delivered Artifacts Documentation**
   - IaC implementations (Terraform, Docker Swarm, K8s) documented in deployment-architecture.md
   - Mock services documented in testing-strategy.md with file locations
   - Actual CI/CD pipeline implementation documented (not just theoretical)

6. **AC6: Story Documentation Structure Decision**
   - Decision made: consolidated vs individual story files
   - If consolidated: documented in core-config.yaml or Epic 1
   - If individual: story-1.1.md through story-1.6.md created

7. **AC7: Documentation Validation**
   - All architecture documents reviewed for remaining inconsistencies
   - Cross-references between Epic 1 and architecture validated
   - No broken links or missing file references

### Story Documentation Decision

**Recommendation: Option B (Consolidated Approach)**

**Rationale:**

- Epic 1 consolidated story documentation is working well
- All story details are in Epic 1 document with clear structure
- QA gates and assessments provide comprehensive story tracking
- Individual story files would duplicate information
- Can revisit for future epics if needed

**If choosing Option A:**

- Use story template: `.bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml`
- Extract acceptance criteria from Epic 1 for each story
- Link to corresponding QA gate files
- Add implementation notes from QA assessments

### Testing

**Validation Testing:**

- Search all architecture docs for version references
- Verify no broken links in updated documents
- Confirm all file paths exist and are accurate
- Cross-reference Epic 1 completion summary with architecture

**Test Commands:**

```bash
# Search for version inconsistencies
grep -r "pg17" docs/architecture/
grep -r "pgvector 0.8" docs/architecture/
grep -r "Python 3.12" docs/architecture/

# Validate file references
find docs/architecture -type f -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "deployment-architecture.md" {} \;

# Check for broken links (manual review or use markdown linter)
```

**Success Criteria:**

- All grep searches return zero results for wrong versions
- All file paths in documentation exist
- Epic 1 Retrospective Action Items marked complete
- Architecture documents align with Epic 1 canonical specs
