DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://agentlab:agentlab@localhost:5433/agentlab_test
POSTGRES_PORT=5433

# Test-specific settings
ENVIRONMENT=test
LOG_LEVEL=WARNING

# Mock API endpoints
CLAUDE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/mock/claude
OPENAI_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/mock/openai
OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:8080/mock/ollama

```

### Docker Test Configuration

**docker-compose.test.yml Services:**

**Test Naming Conventions:**

- Test files: `test_*.py` (Python), `*.test.tsx` (TypeScript)
- Test functions: `test_*` (Python), `it('should ...')` (TypeScript)
- Test fixtures: Descriptive names, lowercase with underscores

**Test Organization:**

- Co-locate unit tests with source code where applicable
- Group integration tests by feature/domain
- Keep E2E tests focused on user journeys, not implementation details

- All tests must be able to run in parallel without conflicts
- Mock services must not require real external API keys
- Test suite should complete in <15 minutes for CI/CD
- Coverage targets: >80% for critical paths, 100% for utilities

### Testing

This story creates the testing infrastructure itself, so validation is primarily manual and integration-focused:

**Validation Requirements:**

- All testing frameworks install successfully without errors
- Sample tests run and pass for each framework (pytest, Vitest, Playwright)
- Mock services start and respond to test requests
- Test database seeds and resets properly
- Coverage reports generate correctly
- CI/CD pipeline runs full test suite successfully
- Environment validation scripts run without errors
- New developer onboarding completes in <10 minutes with passing tests

**Success Criteria:**

- `npm run test` runs frontend tests successfully
- `pytest` runs backend tests successfully
