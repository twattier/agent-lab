## 7. Solution Orientation

### 7.1 Security Posture: **Open**

**Rationale:**
- Data is **Confidential** (business strategy, internal projects) but not **Sensitive/OIV**
- No critical infrastructure or highly sensitive national security data involved
- Primary data: internal IT projects, client requirements, code documentation

**Architectural Implications:**
- Cloud-based deployment acceptable (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Can leverage managed services and third-party integrations
- Standard enterprise security controls sufficient (encryption at rest/transit, RBAC, audit logs)
- Option to use external LLM APIs with appropriate data handling agreements

**Note:** If clients include OIV-designated organizations in the future, security posture should be reassessed to potentially move to **Trust** (sovereign solution with on-premise LLM capabilities).

### 7.2 Solution Architecture Type: **Specific Solution**

**Classification Rationale:**

AgentLab does not fit the generic RAG or Agentic chatbot patterns. It requires:

**Custom Requirements:**
1. **Complex Multi-Entity Data Model:**
   - Clients → Entities → Services → Projects → Applications
   - BMAD Method workflow state machine
   - Gate-based progression logic
   - Template management

2. **External System Integration:**
   - Bidirectional file sync (S3/GitHub)
   - MCP server implementation for Claude Code
   - Future: Claude Code SDK for command invocation
   - Potential: API integration with project management tools (Jira, Azure DevOps) if requested

3. **Specialized Workflows:**
   - BMAD Method gate progression with human-in-the-loop validation
   - Multi-language document management (FR/EN context switching)
   - Template-based project initialization
   - Agent orchestration across qualification, design, and development phases

4. **Custom User Interface:**
   - Dashboard for portfolio visualization
   - Form-based and conversational interfaces for project management
   - File browser/editor for artifact review
   - Client and project hierarchical navigation

**Technology Stack Considerations:**

**Backend:**
- **Framework:** Node.js/TypeScript or Python (FastAPI/Django) for rapid development
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for relational data (clients, projects, users) + vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate) if semantic search needed
- **File Storage:** S3-compatible object storage + GitHub API integration
- **LLM Integration:** OpenAI/Anthropic API for agent capabilities
- **MCP Server:** Custom implementation following Model Context Protocol specification

**Frontend:**
- **Framework:** React or Next.js for modern, responsive UI
- **UI Library:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui for rapid prototyping
- **State Management:** React Query for server state + Zustand/Redux for client state

**Infrastructure:**
- **Deployment:** Docker containers on cloud platform (AWS ECS, Azure Container Apps, or self-hosted)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
- **Monitoring:** Application logs + performance metrics

### 7.3 Deployment Model

**Phase 1 (MVP):**
- **Single-tenant cloud deployment** for DSI internal use
- Managed database and storage services
- Docker-based application containers

**Phase 2+ (Scale):**
- **Multi-tenant architecture** if expanded to other departments
- **Hybrid option:** Core platform cloud-hosted, sensitive data on-premise
- **Open-source potential:** Consider open-sourcing core framework if valuable to community

## 8. Multi-Language Complexity

### 8.1 Challenge Description

**Context Switching Requirements:**
- **User Input:** Users (French-speaking POs) may qualify use cases in French or English (not systematic)
- **Claude Code Requirements:** Development environment expects English inputs (PRD, architecture) and produces English outputs
- **Document Generation:** Users may request PRD in French OR English
- **Feedback Loop:** Users may provide French feedback on English documents, which must then be processed by Claude Code in English
- **Configuration Files:** `.claude/` and BMAD Method configs are strictly English

**Core Problem:** Maintain two synchronized versions (FR/EN) without confusing LLM agents by mixing languages in a single context.

### 8.2 Approach (Start Simple, Iterate)

**Phase 1 - Minimal Viable Approach:**
- **Default Language Tagging:** Each document has a primary language flag (FR or EN)
- **Manual Language Selection:** User explicitly chooses output language when generating documents
- **Simple Translation:** Basic LLM-powered translation on demand (not automatic)
- **Claude Code Handoff Rule:** Always provide English versions to Claude Code, regardless of user preference for review

**Phase 2 - Enhanced Management:**
- **Dual Document Storage:** Store FR and EN versions as separate entities with linkage
- **Change Detection:** Flag when one version is modified without updating the other
- **Assisted Translation:** Agent-powered translation with change highlighting
- **Bilingual Review UI:** Side-by-side view for validation

**Phase 3 - Intelligent Orchestration:**
- **Master + Translation Pattern:** Define which version is authoritative (likely EN for technical docs)
- **Auto-sync Workflow:** Detect changes and propose translation updates
- **Context-Aware Agents:** Agents understand which language to use based on target (user review vs. code generation)

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- Store language metadata with each document
- Use LLM with explicit language instructions: "You are reviewing a document in French. Provide feedback in French. When updating technical specifications, ensure English version consistency."
- Markdown documents can include language indicator in frontmatter
- MCP service provides language-aware document retrieval
