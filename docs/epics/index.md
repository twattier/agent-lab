## 🔄 Epic Review Process

Each epic must pass the following validation before proceeding:

1. **Technical Review**: Architecture and implementation approach validated
2. **PO Validation**: Requirements completeness and scope alignment confirmed
3. **QA Review**: Testing strategy and quality gates defined
4. **Stakeholder Sign-off**: Business requirements and acceptance criteria approved

**Current Status**: All epics have passed PO Master Checklist validation and are approved for implementation.
