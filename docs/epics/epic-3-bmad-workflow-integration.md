**Epic Scope:**
This epic implements:

- BMAD workflow template import from Claude Code configuration
- Gate management interface for human reviewers
- Workflow progression and state management
- Conversational agent interface for qualification assistance
- Integration with Claude Code project directories
- Feedback and validation result writing to markdown folders
