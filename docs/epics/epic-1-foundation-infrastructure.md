# Epic 1: Foundation & Infrastructure Setup

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-09-30)
**Quality Gate:** PASS (All 6 stories completed with QA approval)
**Overall Quality Score:** 95/100

## Epic Goal

Establish the foundational development environment, infrastructure, and core project scaffolding for AgentLab, enabling subsequent feature development with a robust, scalable foundation.

## Epic Description

**Project Context:**
AgentLab is a greenfield productivity platform for DSI Product Owners managing 10-25 concurrent AI development projects. This epic establishes the fundamental infrastructure needed to support BMAD Method automation, Claude Code integration, and bilingual document management.

**Epic Scope:**
This epic creates the essential project foundation including:

- Project initialization and repository setup with external service documentation
- Docker-compose containerized development environment
- Core database infrastructure (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
- Basic API framework (FastAPI)
- Frontend foundation (Next.js + TypeScript + shadcn/ui)
- Development tooling and configuration
- CI/CD pipeline setup and automated testing infrastructure

## Story Documentation Approach

**Epic 1 uses a consolidated story documentation approach** where all story details, acceptance criteria, and implementation notes are maintained within this epic document rather than in separate story files. This approach was chosen for the following reasons:

- **Cohesive Context:** All foundation stories are tightly coupled and best understood together
- **Reduced Duplication:** Story details, QA gates, and assessments already provide comprehensive tracking
- **Efficient Navigation:** Single document provides complete epic picture without file hopping
- **Successful Pattern:** Proven effective for Epic 1 completion (95/100 quality score)

QA gates (`docs/qa/gates/1.x-*.yml`) and QA assessments (`docs/qa/assessments/1.x-*.yml`) provide formal story tracking and validation. Individual story files (e.g., `story-1.7-architecture-documentation-alignment.md`) are created only for complex post-completion work requiring detailed developer handoff.

**Decision:** Retain consolidated approach for Epic 1. Future epics may use individual story files based on complexity and team preference.

## Stories (7 Total - 6 Complete, 1 Post-Completion Fix)

1. **Story 1.1:** Project Scaffolding and Repository Setup ✅
   - **Initialize repository with explicit commands:**
     ```bash

## ⚠️ Post-Completion Findings & Required Actions

### Critical: Architecture Documentation Alignment Required

**Retrospective Date:** 2025-09-30
**Reviewer:** Sarah (Product Owner)
**Finding:** Version mismatches between Epic 1 canonical specifications and architecture documents

#### 🚨 Version Inconsistencies to Fix

| Component      | Epic 1 Canonical      | Architecture Docs | Status          | Priority    |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| **PostgreSQL** | 15.4 + pgvector 0.5.0 | pg17              | ❌ MISMATCH     | P1-Critical |
| **pgvector**   | 0.5.0                 | 0.8+              | ❌ MISMATCH     | P1-Critical |
| **Python**     | 3.11.5                | 3.11.5+ / 3.12    | ⚠️ INCONSISTENT | P2-High     |
| **FastAPI**    | 0.103.0+              | 0.115+            | ⚠️ VERIFY       | P3-Medium   |
| **TypeScript** | 5.1.6+                | 5.3+              | ⚠️ VERIFY       | P3-Medium   |
| Next.js        | 13.4.19+              | 13.4.19+          | ✅ ALIGNED      | None        |
| Node.js        | 18.17.0               | 18                | ✅ ALIGNED      | None        |
| Redis          | 7.0-alpine            | 7.x               | ✅ ALIGNED      | None        |

#### Required Architecture Document Updates

**P1-Critical (Must Fix Before Epic 2):**

1. **[docs/architecture/deployment-architecture.md](docs/architecture/deployment-architecture.md)**
   - Line 59: Change `pgvector/pgvector:pg17` → `pgvector/pgvector:pg15`
   - Line 122: Change `pgvector/pgvector:pg17` → `pgvector/pgvector:pg15`
   - Line 175: Change Python `3.12` → `3.11.5`

2. **[docs/architecture/tech-stack.md](docs/architecture/tech-stack.md)**
   - Line 15: Change pgvector `0.8+` → `0.5.0` (or document upgrade decision)
   - Line 12: Verify FastAPI version (0.103 vs 0.115) and align
   - Line 7: Verify TypeScript version (5.1.6 vs 5.3) and align

**P2-High (Should Complete):**

3. **Integrate Delivered Artifacts into Architecture Docs**
   - Add IaC implementation details (Terraform, Docker Swarm, K8s) to deployment-architecture.md
   - Update testing-strategy.md with actual delivered mock services and test infrastructure
   - Document actual CI/CD pipeline implementation (not just theoretical)

4. **Story Documentation**
   - Decision needed: Create individual story files (story-1.1.md through 1.6.md) OR
   - Document that Epic 1 uses consolidated epic-level documentation approach

**P3-Medium (Future Enhancement):**

5. **Bidirectional Traceability**
   - Add Epic/Story references in architecture documents
   - Link architecture sections to implementing stories
   - Create architecture changelog tracking Epic implementations

### Technical Debt Status

**Story 1.4 Technical Debt:** All high and medium priority items resolved (TD-1.4-001 through TD-1.4-005)
**Story 1.6 Operational Validation:** Requires live GitHub Actions execution to validate performance targets

### Risks Mitigated

✅ Docker environment complexity - Comprehensive documentation and automation
✅ Cross-platform compatibility - Tested on multiple OS environments
✅ Dependency version conflicts - All versions pinned and validated
✅ Security vulnerabilities - Scanning active, secrets properly managed

---

## 📋 Handoff Notes for Epic 2

- ⚠️ Delivered IaC artifacts not yet integrated into architecture docs

### Dependencies for Epic 2

- Epic 1 provides complete foundation infrastructure
- No blockers for Epic 2 commencement
- Architecture alignment should be completed in parallel with Epic 2 Story 2.1
