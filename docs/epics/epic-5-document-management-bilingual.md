# Epic 5: Document Management & Bilingual Support

## Epic Goal
Implement comprehensive document management with GitHub-style change tracking, mermaid diagram rendering, and bilingual support for French business requirements and English technical documentation.

## Epic Description

**Project Context:**
AgentLab serves DSI's bilingual environment where business requirements are in French and technical documentation is in English. The platform must seamlessly handle document display, versioning, and language switching while supporting rich markdown content and diagrams.

**Epic Scope:**
This epic implements:
- Markdown document display with GitHub-style rendering
- Change tracking and version management
- Mermaid diagram rendering support
- Bilingual document management (French/English)
- Document synchronization with Claude Code projects
- Document search and navigation
- Export capabilities for development handoff

## Stories

   - Implement diagram export (SVG, PNG)
   - Create diagram library for reusable components

3. **Story 5.3:** Version Control & Change Tracking
   - Implement GitHub-style diff visualization
   - Create document version history interface
   - Add change attribution and timestamps
   - Build merge conflict resolution interface
   - Create rollback and restore capabilities

4. **Story 5.4:** Bilingual Document Management
   - Implement language detection and tagging
   - Create seamless French/English switching interface
   - Add translation workflow support
   - Build language-specific search and filtering
   - Create bilingual glossary and terminology management

5. **Story 5.5:** Document Synchronization & Export
   - Implement real-time sync with Claude Code projects
   - Create document export for development handoff
   - Add batch document operations
   - Build document template management
   - Create automated documentation generation

## Success Criteria

### Document Display Requirements
- [ ] All markdown features render correctly (tables, lists, code, links)
- [ ] Mermaid diagrams render with professional quality
- [ ] Document loading times under 1 second for typical documents
- [ ] Print and export formats maintain professional appearance
- [ ] Code syntax highlighting supports all relevant languages

### Version Control Requirements
- [ ] Change tracking preserves complete document history
- [ ] Diff visualization clearly shows additions/deletions/modifications
- [ ] Merge conflicts detected and resolved gracefully
- [ ] Version rollback maintains data integrity
- [ ] Collaboration features support multiple simultaneous editors

### Bilingual Support Requirements
- [ ] Language switching occurs seamlessly without page reload
- [ ] French business content and English technical docs both fully supported
- [ ] Search works across both languages
- [ ] Translation workflows integrate with existing processes
- [ ] Terminology management maintains consistency

## Technical Implementation

### Document Processing Pipeline
```
Document Input
├── Markdown Parsing (unified.js)
├── Language Detection (franc.js)
├── Mermaid Diagram Processing
├── Syntax Highlighting (Prism.js)
├── Change Tracking (diff algorithm)
└── Rendered Output
```

### Bilingual Architecture
- Language tagging at document and section levels
- Translation memory for consistency
- Language-specific search indexing
- Cultural localization (dates, numbers, formatting)
- Bidirectional text support preparation

### Document Storage
```
Document
├── id: UUID
├── project_id: UUID (FK)
├── title: String
├── content: Text (markdown)
├── language: Enum (fr, en)
├── version: Integer
├── author: String
├── created_at: Timestamp
├── updated_at: Timestamp
└── metadata: JSONB

DocumentVersion
├── id: UUID
├── document_id: UUID (FK)
├── version_number: Integer
├── content: Text
├── changes: JSONB (diff)
├── author: String
└── created_at: Timestamp
```

## Integration Requirements

### Claude Code Synchronization
- Real-time bidirectional sync
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Offline capability with sync on reconnect
- Selective sync configuration
- Sync status and error reporting

### Search & Navigation
- Full-text search across all documents
- Language-aware search ranking
- Faceted search by project, language, type
- Auto-complete for document titles and content
- Recent documents and favorites

## Performance Targets
- Document render time: < 1 second for 50KB documents
- Mermaid diagram render: < 2 seconds for complex diagrams
- Search results: < 500ms for full-text queries
- Language switching: < 200ms
- Document save operations: < 500ms

## Accessibility Features
- Screen reader support for document structure
- Keyboard navigation for document browsing
- High contrast mode for document reading
- Zoom support for diagrams and content
- Alternative descriptions for mermaid diagrams

## Dependencies
- **Internal:** Epic 2 (Core Data Management) - Document metadata storage
- **Internal:** Epic 3 (BMAD Integration) - Claude Code synchronization
- **External:** Mermaid.js, unified.js, Prism.js, diff libraries

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk:** Large document performance issues
  - **Mitigation:** Implement virtual scrolling and lazy loading
- **Risk:** Complex mermaid diagram rendering problems
  - **Mitigation:** Fallback to static images for complex diagrams
- **Risk:** Synchronization conflicts with Claude Code
  - **Mitigation:** Comprehensive conflict resolution UI
- **Risk:** Translation consistency issues
  - **Mitigation:** Terminology management and validation tools
