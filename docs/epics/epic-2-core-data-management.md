# Epic 2: Core Data Management & Client Hierarchy

## Epic Goal
Implement the fundamental data management system for AgentLab, including client hierarchy management, project lifecycle tracking, and the foundational data models that support all platform functionality.

## Epic Description

**Project Context:**
AgentLab requires a robust data management foundation to handle client hierarchies (Client → Service), project categorization, and BMAD Method workflow states. This epic establishes the core data layer that enables all subsequent features.

**Epic Scope:**
This epic implements:
- Client and Service hierarchy management with contact information
- Project lifecycle management with comprehensive categorization
- BMAD workflow state tracking and progression
- Data validation and integrity constraints
- Basic CRUD operations for core entities

## Stories

1. **Story 2.1:** Client & Service Hierarchy Management
   - Implement Client and Service database models
   - Create contact information storage (name + email)
   - Add business domain classification system
   - Build client hierarchy CRUD operations
   - Implement client management API endpoints

2. **Story 2.2:** Project Data Models & Lifecycle
   - Create comprehensive project data model
   - Implement project categorization (type, implementation, user, domain)
   - Add project status and lifecycle state management
   - Create project metadata and description handling
   - Build project CRUD operations and API endpoints

3. **Story 2.3:** BMAD Workflow State Management
   - Implement workflow template import from configuration
   - Create workflow progression state tracking
   - Add gate status management (pending, approved, rejected)
   - Implement workflow stage transitions
   - Create workflow state query and update APIs

4. **Story 2.4:** Document Metadata Management
   - Create document tracking and metadata storage
   - Implement GitHub-style change tracking
   - Add document version management
   - Create document-to-project associations
   - Build document management API endpoints

5. **Story 2.5:** Data Validation, Integrity & Seed Data Management
   - **Implement comprehensive data validation rules:**
     - Pydantic models for API request/response validation
     - Database constraints for data integrity
     - Business logic validation for workflow states
     - Input sanitization and security validation
   - **Add referential integrity constraints:**
     - Foreign key relationships between all entities
     - Cascade delete rules for data consistency
     - Unique constraints for business rules
     - Check constraints for enum validations
   - **Create comprehensive migration and seeding strategy:**
     - Alembic migration scripts for schema evolution
     - Development seed data: Sample clients, services, projects
     - Test seed data: Comprehensive test scenarios and edge cases
     - Production seed data: Initial system configuration and default values
   - **Seed data specifications:**
     - 3-5 sample clients with realistic business domains
     - 10-15 sample services across different client types
     - 20-25 sample projects covering all categorization types
     - BMAD workflow templates and initial configurations
     - User accounts and authentication test data
   - **Implement audit logging and data management:**
     - Change tracking for all data modifications
     - User action logging for compliance
     - Data export capabilities (CSV, JSON formats)
     - Automated backup procedures and restore capabilities

## Success Criteria

### Data Model Requirements
- [ ] All entities properly normalized and related
- [ ] Referential integrity maintained across all operations
- [ ] Data validation prevents invalid states
- [ ] Migration scripts handle schema evolution
- [ ] Performance acceptable for expected data volumes

### API Requirements
- [ ] CRUD operations available for all core entities
- [ ] API endpoints follow RESTful conventions
- [ ] Response times under 200ms for standard operations
- [ ] Proper error handling and validation messages
- [ ] API documentation generated and accurate

### Business Logic Requirements
- [ ] Client hierarchy correctly enforced
- [ ] Project categorization supports all PRD requirements
- [ ] Workflow state transitions follow BMAD Method rules
- [ ] Document versioning preserves change history
- [ ] Data deletion follows confirmation requirements

## Data Models

### Client Hierarchy
```
Client
├── id: UUID
├── name: String
├── contact_name: String
├── contact_email: String
├── business_domain: Enum
└── services: [Service]

Service
├── id: UUID
├── client_id: UUID (FK)
├── name: String
├── contact_name: String
├── contact_email: String
└── projects: [Project]
```

### Project Management
```
Project
├── id: UUID
├── service_id: UUID (FK)
├── name: String
├── description: Text
├── project_type: Enum (new/existing)
├── implementation_type: Enum
├── user_type: Enum
├── business_domain: Enum
├── status: Enum
├── workflow_state: JSONB
├── created_at: Timestamp
└── updated_at: Timestamp
```

## Dependencies
- **Internal:** Epic 1 (Foundation & Infrastructure) - Database and API framework
- **External:** PostgreSQL with JSON support, pgvector extension

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk:** Data model changes requiring migration
  - **Mitigation:** Use Alembic for versioned database migrations
- **Risk:** Performance with large datasets
  - **Mitigation:** Implement proper indexing and query optimization
- **Risk:** Data integrity violations
  - **Mitigation:** Comprehensive validation at both API and database levels

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All 5 stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Data models support all PRD functional requirements
- [ ] API endpoints tested and documented
- [ ] Migration scripts validated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security review completed for data access patterns
