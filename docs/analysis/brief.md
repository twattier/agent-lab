# Project Brief: AgentLab

## Executive Summary

AgentLab is an internal AI-powered project management platform designed to streamline DSI's software development workflow through BMAD Method automation. The platform addresses critical efficiency bottlenecks in project qualification processes by providing agent-assisted workflows, centralized project context, and seamless Claude Code integration. Initially developed for internal DSI usage to validate workflow automation value, with potential future open-source release to leverage community contributions for accelerated improvement.

## Problem Statement

**Current State:** DSI faces significant productivity challenges managing multiple AI-powered development projects across client portfolios:

- **Fragmented Information:** Project documentation, requirements, and technical specifications scattered across tools and formats, leading to context switching overhead and information loss
- **Manual Overhead:** Repetitive qualification activities and documentation management consuming 20-30% of Product Owner time that could be redirected to higher-value activities
- **Lost Context:** Difficulty tracking project history, decisions, and current state across 10+ active projects and existing applications, resulting in rework and quality issues
- **Integration Gap:** Disconnect between business requirements (often in French) and technical implementation requirements (English for Claude Code), creating translation and synchronization overhead
- **Portfolio Invisibility:** No centralized view of client services, project status, or resource allocation across the DSI organization

**Impact Quantification:** Based on current DSI operations with 3 Product Owners managing 10-25 concurrent projects each, inefficiencies result in:

- Estimated 20-30% productivity loss due to context switching and information search
- Rework cycles due to incomplete qualification and gate validation processes
- Client delivery delays from project management overhead

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:** Traditional project management tools (Jira, Azure DevOps) lack:

- BMAD Method workflow specialization and automation
- Native AI development tool integration (Claude Code)
- Bilingual document management capabilities
- Agent-assisted qualification and validation processes

**Urgency:** With increasing adoption of AI development tools across the industry, DSI needs workflow optimization to maintain competitive advantage in client delivery speed and quality.

## Proposed Solution

**Core Concept:** AgentLab provides an integrated platform that automates BMAD Method qualification workflows, maintains centralized project context, and seamlessly integrates with Claude Code for AI-powered development processes.

**Key Differentiators:**

- **BMAD Method Native:** First platform designed specifically around BMAD Method workflow automation with intelligent gate validation
- **Claude Code Deep Integration:** Bidirectional file synchronization and context sharing with development environment via MCP protocol
- **Bilingual by Design:** Native French/English document management with AI-assisted translation and synchronization
- **Agent-Assisted Workflows:** AI agents guide users through qualification, requirements gathering, and validation processes

**Why This Solution Will Succeed:** Unlike generic project management tools that require extensive customization, AgentLab is purpose-built for modern AI development methodologies, providing immediate value through specialized workflows and intelligent automation.

**High-Level Vision:** Transform DSI into a highly efficient AI development organization where project qualification happens seamlessly, context is never lost, and teams can focus on creative problem-solving rather than administrative overhead.
