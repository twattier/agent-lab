# User Interface Design Goals

## üé® Overall UX Vision

Clean, professional dashboard-centric interface optimized for productivity-focused Product Owners managing multiple concurrent projects. Emphasizes quick context switching between projects, clear workflow status visualization, and minimal cognitive overhead during qualification processes. Design philosophy: "Information architecture over visual flourish" - every UI element serves workflow efficiency.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Dashboard-First Navigation:** Primary entry point showing portfolio overview with quick drill-down to project details
- **Contextual Workflow Progression:** Visual workflow state indicators with one-click navigation to current stage tasks
- **Conversational Assistance:** Integrated Claude Code agent access within project context for qualification support
- **Document-Centric Views:** GitHub-style markdown rendering with change tracking for PRD/architecture document review
- **Bilingual Content Switching:** Seamless toggle between French business content and English technical documentation

## Core Screens and Views

- **Portfolio Dashboard:** Multi-client project overview with status indicators, recent activity feed, and quick access actions
- **Project Detail Page:** Comprehensive project context including BMAD workflow status, document access, and agent interface
- **Client Management Interface:** Two-level client/service hierarchy with contact management and business domain classification
- **Gate Review Interface:** Workflow stage validation with approval/rejection controls and comment capture
- **Document Viewer:** Markdown rendering with mermaid diagram support and GitHub-style change visualization
- **File Sync Status Page:** Claude Code integration status and on-demand synchronization controls
- **Workflow Status Visualization:** Visual indicators for current project stage/status in workflow progression
- **Multi-Level Project Views:** List ‚Üí Card (quick view) ‚Üí Full detail hierarchy for different information needs

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

Essential for professional DSI environment and potential future open-source adoption. Focus on keyboard navigation for power users, semantic HTML structure, and screen reader compatibility for inclusive development practices.

## Branding

Minimal, professional aesthetic aligned with DSI corporate standards. Clean typography, subtle color palette emphasizing workflow status indicators (green=approved, yellow=pending, red=blocked). Avoid overly stylized elements that could distract from productivity workflow focus.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Optimized for desktop workflow (primary Product Owner usage) with tablet compatibility for client meetings and mobile access for status checking. No native mobile app required for MVP - responsive web interface sufficient for occasional mobile usage patterns.
