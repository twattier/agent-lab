# Goals and Background Context

## üéØ Goals

- **Productivity Enhancement:** Achieve 30-50% reduction in Product Owner administrative overhead through workflow automation
- **Quality Improvement:** Reduce project rework rate by 25% through enhanced gate validation and context management
- **Delivery Acceleration:** Decrease average project qualification time from concept to development-ready by 40%
- **Knowledge Retention:** Eliminate information loss during project transitions and team changes through centralized context management
- **Workflow Integration:** Seamlessly integrate BMAD Method qualification workflows with Claude Code development environment

## Background Context

AgentLab addresses critical productivity bottlenecks in DSI's AI-powered development workflow management. Currently, Product Owners manage 10-25 concurrent projects while facing information fragmentation across multiple tools, language switching overhead between French business requirements and English technical documentation, and manual qualification processes that consume 20-30% of productive time.

The platform leverages purpose-built BMAD Method automation, native Claude Code integration via MCP protocol, and bilingual document management to transform DSI into a highly efficient AI development organization where teams focus on creative problem-solving rather than administrative overhead.
