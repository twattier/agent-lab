# Epic 1 Retrospective: Action Items & Fixes

**Date Created:** 2025-09-30
**Epic:** Epic 1 - Foundation & Infrastructure Setup
**Status:** Epic Complete - Documentation Alignment Required (Story 1.7 Created)
**Owner:** Product Owner (Sarah)
**Tracking Story:** [Story 1.7 - Architecture Documentation Alignment](../../stories/story-1.7-architecture-documentation-alignment.md)
**Next Review:** Before Epic 2 Story 2.1 commencement

---

## Executive Summary

Epic 1 successfully delivered all 6 stories with QA approval (95/100 overall quality). However, retrospective analysis identified **critical version mismatches** between Epic 1 canonical specifications and architecture documentation requiring immediate correction.

**Impact:** Architecture documents reference wrong versions (PostgreSQL pg17 vs 15.4, pgvector 0.8 vs 0.5.0) that could cause deployment failures and environment inconsistencies.

**Resolution:** **Story 1.7 - Architecture Documentation Alignment** created to track all fixes. This story consolidates all action items into a single trackable unit with 7 acceptance criteria, 10 tasks, and estimated 4-5 hour effort.

## üö® P1-Critical Actions (Must Fix Before Epic 2)

### Action 1: Fix PostgreSQL Version References

**Issue:** Architecture documents specify PostgreSQL 17, but Epic 1 canonical version is PostgreSQL 15.4
**Impact:** Docker deployment will use wrong PostgreSQL version, potential pgvector incompatibility
**Priority:** P1-Critical

**Files to Update:**

1. **[docs/architecture/deployment-architecture.md](../architecture/deployment-architecture.md)**

   ```yaml
   Current (Line 59): image: pgvector/pgvector:pg17
   Fix To:            image: pgvector/pgvector:pg15

   Current (Line 122): image: pgvector/pgvector:pg17
   Fix To:             image: pgvector/pgvector:pg15
   ```

   **Validation:** Search entire file for `pg17` and replace all instances with `pg15`

**Owner:** Winston (Architect)
**Estimated Effort:** 10 minutes
**Status:** üî¥ NOT STARTED

---

### Action 2: Fix pgvector Extension Version

**Issue:** Tech stack specifies pgvector 0.8+, but Epic 1 canonical version is 0.5.0
**Impact:** Version mismatch may cause feature incompatibilities or deployment issues
**Priority:** P1-Critical

**Files to Update:**

1. **[docs/architecture/tech-stack.md](../architecture/tech-stack.md)**

   ```yaml
   Current (Line 15): pgvector | 0.8+ | Vector similarity search extension
   Fix To:            pgvector | 0.5.0 | Vector similarity search extension

   Update Rationale column to:
   "Epic 1 canonical version, integrated with PostgreSQL 15.4"
   ```

**Alternative Decision Point:**

- **Option A:** Update to 0.5.0 (aligns with Epic 1 delivered infrastructure)
- **Option B:** Document upgrade decision and update Epic 1 + infrastructure to 0.8+

**Owner:** Winston (Architect) + Dev Lead
**Estimated Effort:** 15 minutes (+ testing if upgrading)
**Status:** üî¥ NOT STARTED
**Decision Required:** Confirm whether to align to 0.5.0 or upgrade to 0.8+

---

### Action 3: Standardize Python Version References

**Issue:** Mixed Python version references (3.11.5 in tech stack, 3.12 in deployment examples)
**Impact:** CI/CD workflow inconsistency, potential dependency conflicts
**Priority:** P2-High (escalate to P1 if affecting builds)

**Files to Update:**

1. **[docs/architecture/deployment-architecture.md](../architecture/deployment-architecture.md)**

   ```yaml
   Current (Line 175): python-version: '3.12'
   Fix To:             python-version: '3.11.5'
   ```

2. **[docs/architecture/tech-stack.md](../architecture/tech-stack.md)**
   ```yaml
   Current (Line 11): Python | 3.11.5+ | ...
   Verify: Should be exactly "3.11.5" to match Epic 1 canonical
   ```

**Validation:**

- Search all architecture docs for Python version references
- Ensure CI/CD workflows use Python 3.11.5
- Verify `.python-version` file matches

**Owner:** Winston (Architect)
**Estimated Effort:** 20 minutes
**Status:** üî¥ NOT STARTED
