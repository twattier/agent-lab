## üîç Quality Score Analysis

### Story 2.3: 99/100 (-1 Point)

**Missing Point Identified:**

Based on Story 2.3 documentation review, the -1 point likely relates to:

**Potential Gap:** WorkflowEvent audit trail completeness

- **AC5 Requirement:** "Automatic event creation on all workflow state changes"
- **Possible Issue:** Event creation may not cover all edge cases (e.g., MANUAL_OVERRIDE scenarios, gate re-approvals)

**Recommendation for Epic 3:**

- Validate WorkflowEvent audit trail covers 100% of workflow state mutations
- Add integration tests for manual override scenarios
- Ensure gate re-approval cycles properly logged

---

### Story 2.4: 98/100 (-2 Points)

**Missing Points Identified:**

Based on Story 2.4 documentation review, the -2 points likely relate to:

**Potential Gap 1:** Semantic search implementation completeness

- **AC10 Requirement:** "Implement similarity search with pgvector"
- **Possible Issue:** Embeddings generation may not be fully automated on document updates
- **Risk:** Missing embedding updates could cause stale search results

**Potential Gap 2:** Comment resolution workflow

- **AC13 Requirement:** "Comment management"
- **Possible Issue:** Comment resolution workflow may lack business logic validation (e.g., who can resolve, when)
- **Risk:** Incomplete comment lifecycle management

**Additional Note from Story 2.5:**

- Story 2.5 documentation mentions: "Story 2.4 migration state inconsistent, worked around"
- This suggests a database migration issue that may have contributed to the -2 point deduction

**Recommendation for Epic 3:**

- Validate embedding generation triggers on all document content changes
- Add integration tests for semantic search with various query types
- Clarify comment resolution workflow (authorization, lifecycle)
- Review and fix Story 2.4 migration inconsistencies

---

## üö® Issues Encountered (with Resolutions)

### Issue 1: Story 2.4 Migration State Inconsistency

**Issue:** Story 2.5 documentation notes "Story 2.4 migration state inconsistent, worked around"

**Impact:**

- Potential Alembic migration history misalignment
- Risk of migration conflicts in future stories or Epic 3
- May have contributed to Story 2.4's 98/100 score

**Resolution Applied:** Worked around during Story 2.5 execution (specific workaround not documented)

**Recommended Action:**

- **Priority:** P2-High
- **Action:** Validate Alembic migration history consistency
- **Validation:** Run `alembic history`, ensure linear progression, verify all migrations applied
- **Fix:** If inconsistent, create corrective migration or reset to canonical state
- **Owner:** Dev Lead
- **Effort:** 1-2 hours
- **Timeline:** Before Epic 3 Story 3.1 commencement
