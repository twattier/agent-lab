## ðŸšª Quality Gates

Quality gates ensure that each development milestone meets established quality standards before progression.

### [ðŸ“„ Story Quality Gate Template](./gates/story-quality-gate-template.yml)
**Purpose**: Standardized quality validation template for individual stories
**Content**: Validation checklist, acceptance criteria verification, testing requirements
**Key Sections**:
- Functional requirement validation
- Technical implementation review
- Testing completeness verification
- Documentation standards compliance

**Usage**: Applied to every story before marking as "Done"

## ðŸŽ¯ Quality Assurance Process

### 1. Story-Level Quality Gates
Each story must pass the quality gate before being considered complete:
- **Functional Validation**: All acceptance criteria met
- **Technical Review**: Code quality, architecture compliance
- **Testing Coverage**: Unit tests, integration tests where applicable
- **Documentation**: API docs, code comments, user-facing documentation

### 2. Epic-Level Quality Validation
Each epic undergoes comprehensive validation:
- **Integration Testing**: Cross-component functionality
- **Performance Testing**: Meets performance benchmarks
- **Security Review**: Security best practices implemented
- **User Acceptance**: Stakeholder validation of deliverables

### 3. System-Level Quality Assurance
Full system validation before releases:
- **End-to-End Testing**: Complete user workflows
- **Load Testing**: Performance under expected load
- **Security Audit**: Comprehensive security review
- **Accessibility Testing**: WCAG AA compliance validation
