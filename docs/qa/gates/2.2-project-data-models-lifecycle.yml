  gate_rationale: |
    Story 2.2 receives a PASS gate with high confidence. The implementation is comprehensive,
    well-tested, and production-ready. All 35 acceptance criteria are fully met with evidence
    from 81 passing tests. The code follows best practices, maintains consistency with Story 2.1,
    and demonstrates excellent architectural decisions. Database design is solid with proper
    constraints, indexes, and CASCADE behavior. API endpoints are fully functional with
    comprehensive validation and error handling. The only areas noted for future enhancement
    are optional improvements that do not block production deployment.
