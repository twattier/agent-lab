# Quality Gate Summary
summary: |
  Story 1.4 implementation successfully delivers a functional Next.js frontend foundation
  with all core dependencies properly configured. Production build passes, tests execute
  successfully, and API client architecture is sound. However, significant technical debt
  exists around React type conflicts requiring workarounds, insufficient test coverage
  (only 1 component test), and missing service layer implementation. While the foundation
  is solid for continued development, these concerns should be addressed in upcoming stories.

# Gate Decision Rationale
decision_rationale: |
  PASS_WITH_CONCERNS is appropriate because:

  STRENGTHS:
  - All 5 acceptance criteria verified and passing
  - Production build successful (npm run build)
  - Core architecture follows PRD specifications
  - Dependency management strategy documented and validated
  - API client properly type-safe with error handling
  - State management (React Query + Zustand) correctly configured
  - MSW testing infrastructure in place

  CONCERNS (must address in future stories):
  1. React types conflict requiring `any` type workaround in providers.tsx
  2. Test coverage insufficient - only Button component tested (4 tests total)
  3. No integration tests for API client, hooks, or pages
  4. Service layer files (client-service.ts, project-service.ts) not implemented
  5. Type assertion workaround in MSW handlers using Record<string, unknown>
  6. Missing hooks/use-api.ts implementation referenced in requirements

  The concerns are technical debt that can be refactored in upcoming stories without
  blocking Epic 1 progress. The foundation is functional and meets all ACs.
