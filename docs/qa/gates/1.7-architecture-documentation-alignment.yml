  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No security implications. Enhances security by documenting correct versions for vulnerability tracking.'

assessment:
  strengths:
    - 'Systematic 5-phase execution approach'
    - 'Complete requirements traceability with Given-When-Then validation'
    - 'Comprehensive validation using grep searches'
    - 'Thorough documentation of delivered artifacts (IaC, mock services, CI/CD)'
    - 'Clear decision-making with documented rationale'

  exemplary_practices:
    - 'Completion notes provide excellent audit trail'
    - 'File list maintained accurately throughout'
    - 'Validation evidence documented for each AC'
    - 'Phased approach with clear priorities (P1-Critical → P5-Validation)'

technical_debt:
  identified: NONE
  eliminated:
    - 'Epic 1 architecture documentation inconsistencies'
    - 'Undocumented IaC implementations'
    - 'Undocumented mock services'
    - 'Undocumented CI/CD pipeline implementation'

risk_profile:

conclusion: |
  Story 1.7 represents exemplary documentation quality work. All acceptance criteria
  validated with comprehensive evidence. Zero incorrect version references remain after
  grep validation. This story eliminates Epic 1 technical debt and prepares architecture
  documentation for Epic 2. The systematic approach, complete traceability, and thorough
  validation make this a model story for future documentation work.
