    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Cascade delete properly configured in models but migration used manual SQL. Need integration test to verify behavior. Error handling is comprehensive.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean separation of concerns (models/schemas/repositories/endpoints). Code follows project conventions. Good docstrings present.'

code_quality_assessment:
  strengths:
    - 'Excellent database model design with proper relationships and constraints'
    - 'Clean repository pattern implementation with appropriate abstraction'
    - 'Comprehensive Pydantic schemas with proper validation'
    - 'Good error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes'
    - 'Proper async/await usage throughout'

  concerns:
    - '49% overall test coverage falls short of 80% requirement'
    - 'New endpoints completely untested (0% coverage for contacts.py and service_categories.py routes)'
    - 'Migration complexity suggests potential Alembic configuration issues'
    - 'Test fixture errors indicate deeper async session management problems'
